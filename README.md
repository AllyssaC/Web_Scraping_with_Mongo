# Web_Scraping_with_Mongo #


In this project, I scraped the NASA website to gather information about Mars and display as a separate URL.  This was an exercise in webscraping which utilized BeautifulSoup, combined with Python in the Jupyter Notebook to pull and organize the file.  I then used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page to display the compiled information.      

Platforms Utilized were:
  * Jupyter Notebook
  * BeautifulSoup 
  * Pandas  
  * Python 
  * Splinter 
  * HTML 
  * Flask
  * MongoDB
